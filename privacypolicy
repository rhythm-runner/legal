    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>[February 20, 2026]</strong></p>

    <p>
      Rhythm Runner (“we,” “us”) provides a running journal experience that can associate your runs with music you listened to.
      This policy explains what we collect and how we use it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account information</strong> (e.g., email, user ID) to create and manage your account.</li>
      <li><strong>Run data</strong> you choose to record (e.g., time, distance, pace).</li>
      <li><strong>Location data</strong> (if you grant permission) to record routes and map moments of your run.</li>
      <li><strong>Music-related data</strong> (if you connect a music service) such as track identifiers and timestamps needed to show what you listened to during a run.</li>
      <li><strong>Device/usage data</strong> (basic diagnostics like crash logs) to improve reliability.</li>
      <li><strong>User content</strong> you choose to upload (e.g., optional photos).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features (saving runs, showing your music timeline, displaying maps).</li>
      <li>Improve performance, fix bugs, and maintain security.</li>
      <li>Provide support and respond to requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with service providers that help operate the app
      (e.g., hosting, analytics, storage), and only as needed to provide the service.
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can disable permissions (like Location) in iOS Settings; some features may not work without them.</li>
      <li>You can request deletion of your account and associated data from within the app (Settings → Delete Account).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your data until you delete it or delete your account, unless we need to keep certain information to comply with law or protect safety.
    </p>
